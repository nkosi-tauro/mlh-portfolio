## Inspiration

FROM DEVS FOR DEVS, THE PYCOMPLETE PROJECT WAS CREATED IN ORDER TO SUPPORT OTHER PROGRAMMERS AND ENHANCE THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE OF BEGINNER CODERS WHO WISH TO BEGIN THEIR CAREER WITH PYTHON!

## What it does

PyComplete is an open source app which utilizes Machine learning in order to provide the best Python suggestions you'd ever need.

## How we built it

Information on how to run PyComplete can be found in the full PyComplete [Docs](https://github.com/MLSquad/PyComplete/blob/main/docs.md). The model is based on [Gallois Autocompleter](https://github.com/galois-autocompleter/galois-autocompleter) which is completely open source. The front end is vanilla.

## Challenge we ran into

Python packages sabotaged us a little since we had problems installing everything and configuring the environment.
The model training took a while, especially as we had to use our own resources since we weren't provided any by the organiser
